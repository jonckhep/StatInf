Now in the second portion of the class, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data 
in the R datasets package. 

Perform data load and have a look at the data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=as.factor(dose), y=len, fill=supp)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity",) +
    facet_grid(. ~ supp) +
    xlab("Dose in miligrams") +
    ylab("Tooth length") +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Supplement type"))
```

As can be seen above, there seems to be a clear positive correlation between the
tooth length and the dose levels of Vitamin C, for both supplement ty pes.
